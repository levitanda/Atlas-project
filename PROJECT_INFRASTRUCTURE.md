# NetworkProject-RAICAT
## General information about the project 
### System Architecture
The system builded from 3 main parts:
* Ripe Atlas - measurements database.
* Django - web server that will serve the GUI as API , and will enacpsulate the ripe atlas API calls for the fronend.
* React - frontend that will show the GUI to the user.
### Functional requirements 
* Modern web browser:
    * Chrome 60+
    * Firefox ESR + 
    * Safari 10.1+/iOS 10.1+
    * Edge 12+ 
    * Opera 47+
* Internet connection
* Installed python ≥ 3.11
#### Development requirements
* Node ≥ 14
### NON-Functional requirements(SKIP)
### Data Design(SKIP)
We don't use any database ,we will only use ripe atlas API , process it and send it to the frontend.
### Deployment and Infrastructure Design
All the system runs on localhost , no need for any external infrastructure. User only need to run a server and open the web page.
### User Interface Design
